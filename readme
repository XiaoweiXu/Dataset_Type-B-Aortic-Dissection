Type-B Aortic Dissection (TBAD) is one of the most serious cardiovascular events characterized by a growing yearly incidence, and the severity of disease prognosis. 
Currently, computed tomography angiography (CTA) has been widely adopted for the diagnosis and prognosis of TBAD.
Accurate segmentation of true lumen (TL), false lumen (FL) and false lumen thrombus (FLT) in CTA is crucial for precise quantification of anatomical features.
However, existing works only focus on only TL and FL without considering FLT.
Here, We propose ImageTBAD, the first 3D computed tomography angiography (CTA) image dataset of TBAD with annotation of TL, FL and FLT.
The proposed dataset contains 100 TBAD CTA images, which is of decent size compared with existing medical imaging datasets.
