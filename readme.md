A dataset of A 3D Computed Tomography (CT) image dataset, ImageTBAD, for segmentation of Type-B Aortic Dissection is published.
ImageTBAD contains 100 3D Computed Tomography (CT) images, which is of decent size compared with existing medical imaging datasets.

ImageTBAD contains a total of 100 3D CTA images gathered from Guangdong Peoples' Hospital Data from January 1,2013 to April 23, 2019. Images are acquired from a variety of scanners (GE Medical Systems, Siemens, Philips), resulting in large variance in voxel size, resolution and imaging quality. All the images are pre-operative TBAD CTA images whose top and bottom are around the neck and the brachiocephalic vessels, respectively, in the axial view. The segmentation labeling is performed by a team of two cardiovascular radiologists who have extensive experience with TBAD. The segmentation labeling of each patient is fulfilled by one radiologist and checked by the other. The segmentation include three substructures: TL, FL, and FLT. There are 68 images containing FLT while 32 images are free of FLT.
